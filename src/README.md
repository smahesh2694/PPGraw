# PPGraw

*PPGraw* is a Python tool developed for the analytical quality review of supposedly raw, unfiltered photoplethysmography signals. This directory contains an excerpt from the raw, unfiltered reference data [ref_sample.p](ref_sample.p), the Python tool itself [PPGraw.py](PPGraw.py), a Jupyter notebook [ref_show.ipynb](ref_show.ipynb) to visualize the reference signal, and a Jupyter notebook [ref_review.ipynb](ref_review.ipynb) that runs a quality review on the reference data and details the 7 multi-varied decision metrics.

* **[ref_sample.p](ref_sample.p)** is a Python Pickle file containing a 3-minute excerpt of the raw, unfiltered photoplethysmography reference data
* **[PPGraw.py](PPGraw.py)** contains the Python class of the analytical tool *PPGraw* for the automated quality review of raw photoplethysmography signals
* **[ref_show.ipynb](ref_show.ipynb)** is a Jupyter notebook that visualizes the provided reference data
* **[ref_review.ipynb](ref_review.ipynb)** is a Jupyter notebook that runs the quality review on the reference data and details the 7 multi-varied decision metrics
